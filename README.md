# ShareLink
This project one of my old project to develop my Node.js and Android skills.
The project is a whatsapp like application not for messaging but sharing interesting web page links amongs created groups.
For backend completely Node.js, for database MongoDB and android application for frontend with very basic UI elements.

- The Autentications
- Verification messages
- Tokens
- Creating Groups
- Sending links
- Sockets
- Basic Routing
- Promises (Node.js)
- Rest APIs

If I would have time continue to develop.
